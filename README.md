Documentation available at http://karun012.github.io/bslider/

_Note: This is a pre release. A minimized production version will be availabe on or before September 30th_

##Getting Started
Refer to the documentation. It's got everything you need to get going. All you need to do is to extend Backbone.Slider, add
some views while extending, create a new instance, and render the slider.

##Do you wish to contribute?
It is pretty simple. I am open to new ideas. Set everything up (refer to the documentation for more information). 
I have tried test driving the code. So please make sure you write tests for any new features that you add. Run them using 
grunt, or by accessing them through the browser (/tests/index.html). Please make sure you add tests to a different file, 
and also ensure that you create an issue for the new feature. Do a pull request. I will do a release in under a week after 
you submit.

##Tests
Tests can be run using Grunt. If you wish to access the QUnit tests directly through a browser, then point your browser to 
the index.html file under /tests. If you are adding new tests, please add them to a separate file, and include the script 
in the existing index.html so that everything is run together. I will soon be making this an easier process. So please 
bear with me.

##Everything Else
Questions, comments, ideas, etc. can be emailed directly to me. If you find an bug, please file it right here. If you 
wish to fix something, or make something better, go ahead! I love refactoring.
