Since the intent was to release early, a snapshot version has been released_\r\n\r\n#Getting Started\r\nBackbone.Slider (BSlider) is built on top of [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org). Make sure Backbone is setup in your application, and you have the CSS files for Backbone.Slider. Backbone.Slider uses [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/). Please be sure to include that. \r\n\r\n####Backbone.Slider\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar MySlider = Backbone.Slider.extend({\r\n    views: [myBackboneViewOne, myBackboneViewTwo] \r\n}); //The Views should be rendered\r\n\r\nvar instance = new MySlider().render();\r\n```\r\n\r\n####addView <code>instance.addView</code>\r\nAdd one more view, or an array of views to an instance of the slider.\r\n\r\n###More features coming soon. Stay tuned!\r\n### Author\r\n@karun012\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nContact me at karun012@gmail.com if you have any questions/comments/suggestions.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
